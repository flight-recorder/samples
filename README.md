# Flight Recorder Samples

This project contains code snippets that illustrates how the JDK Flight Recorder API can be used.

The 'jfr' tool used in the samples was released in JDK 12, but there is an effort to [backport](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8222896) it to JDK 11.

For more information about the API, see the javadoc for
[jdk.jfr](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/jdk.jfr/module-summary.html) and 
[jdk.management.jfr](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/jdk.management.jfr/module-summary.html).
